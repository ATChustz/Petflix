# Petflix

Petflix is an app design to connect dog owners with people who want to walk dogs around. The app is split into two sides, one for the walkers and one for the owners.

# Owner

The owner side of the app revolves the dog that an owner puts up on the app. Each owner can only have one dog registered per user account. The owner has two main flows that they can go through.

The first is messaging walkers. They can access this section by going to the mail symbol on the upper left of their dog's profile page. The object of messaging is to cordinate with the walker on a time and pick up / delivery. This is also an opportunity for the owner to get to know a little bit about the walker so that they can feel more comfortable with the walker walking their dog. They also have the chance to tell the walker more about their dog.

The second is either rejecting or confirming requests from walkers. This can be done under the scheduling tab of the dog's profile.

The first time that a user goes to the owner side of the app they have to sign up as an owner and add a dog before they are able to view their dogs profile.

# Walker

The walker side of the app revolves around selecting a dog and then confirming it.

The walker has the option to either scroll and browse dogs or search for a dog. Eventually they will have the option to filter. 

Once they have selcedted a dog they are taken to the dogs profile and if the user chooses to they can choose to 'chill' with the dog.

Once they are have selected to chill with the dog they are directed to a messaging screen and are recommened to schedule a time, date, location, and pickup method. They are also encouarged to share a little bit about themselves so that the owner can feel more comfortable with them walking their god.

After the walker and user have agreed upon a time they request a walk time through the form at the bottom of the messaging screen. Their requested walks and confirmed walks will show up on their profile page.

The first time that a user goes to the walker side of the app they have to sign up as an walker.
